# This is the Cell-cell interaction analysis. 

In this part, I compared the neuronal cells vs. Microglia in both WT and AD mice. The description for each file is listed here:

1. AD_output: folder contains the CellphoneDB results in AD mice, neuronal cells vs. microglia
2. WT_output: folder contains the CellphoneDB results in WT mice, neuronal cells vs. microglia
3. Figures: folder contains the dot plots and heatmap from CellphoneDB outputs
